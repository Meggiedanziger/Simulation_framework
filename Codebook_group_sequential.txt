nsubj				# maximum number of subjects available for testing

d				# standardized effect (mean difference divided by standard deviation) used for simulation

beta				# type II error used for calculation of bounds in gsDesign

totalN				# total number of subjects (both groups) used for interim analysis at a certain stage

delta_emp			# empirical standardized effect computed from simulated values

t_value				# t-statistic that is computed at each stage

p_value				# p-value computed at each stage (with gsDesign)

df				# degrees of freedom that are calculated by t.test() because of unequal variances in the 2 groups

stage				# stage in which an interim analysis yielded either an upper boundary crossing (= significant p-value) 				                # or a lower boundary crossing 
				
H0				# indicates whether trial was stopped for success (= 2), futility (= 1), or was continued to the next stage (= 0)
